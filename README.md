# Welcome to the RIAPS documentation!

## What is RIAPS?

**Resilient Information Architecture Platform for Smart Grid == RIAPS**

RIAPS is a software platform for building distributed real-time embedded applications using a component-oriented approach. Our application area is power systems - the 'Smart Grid' where RIAPS can serve as the foundation for implementing the *distributed intelligence*.

RIAPS includes:
* Application run-time system
  * A component model
  * A component execution engine
  * A messaging framework
  * A resource and fault management framework
  * A security framework
* Run-time services
  * Discovery service
  * Deployment service (supports resource and fault management)
  * Time synchronization service
* Design-time tools
  * Modeling languages for architecture and deployment
  * Software generators
* Operation services
  * Application deployment and control tool
